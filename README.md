# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Automation-focused developer. I build tools, ship apps, and manage infrastructure with GitOps.

# ⚡️ Kickstart

[`kickstart.linux`](https://github.com/yourusername/kickstart.linux)  
My personal Linux setup: dotfiles, configs, tools, and fonts — all bootstrapped with a single `make` command.

# 🌱 GitOps

[`flux-gitops`](https://github.com/yourusername/flux-gitops)  
My GitOps control repo — drives my entire system with declarative config and continuous deployment.
