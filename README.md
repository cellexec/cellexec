# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Automation-focused developer. I build tools, ship apps, and manage infrastructure with GitOps.

> [!NOTE]  
> I manage everything from setup to services using GitOps + a personal Linux bootstrap repo.

# ⚡️ Kickstart

> [!TIP]  
> My personal Linux setup: dotfiles, configs, tools, and fonts — all bootstrapped with a single `make` command.
